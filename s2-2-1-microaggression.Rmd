# Microagressions and Sexual Harassment. 

**ANALYSIS OF DATA STILL PENDING**

## Microagressions (BIMA001)

Microagression items can be analyzed in relation to gender and age group. However, in case there are sufficient responses for other dimensions of discrimination, these should be explored, i.e. "ethnic minority", "sexual orientation", "disability", "class".

Might consider to group non-mayority responses together.
