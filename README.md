# ACT - Gender Equality Audit and Monitoring (GEAM) - Reporting Template

R bookdown files for generating descriptive statistics and illustrations for the GEAM Core questionnaire. 

The GEAM is an integrated environment for carrying out survey-based gender equality audits in organizations (e.g. university or research performing organization) or organizational units (faculty, departments). It aims to enable interested researchers as well as gender equality practitioners with little experience in the social sciences and survey methodology to construct high-quality questionnaires. 

Documenation on the GEAM, including a manual, is available at [https://geam.act-on-gender.eu](https://geam.act-on-gender.eu). 

The respository contains the R files for generating a descriptive report based upon the data generated by the GEAM Core questionnaire. This includes frequency tables for each question/item as well as illustrations. The output format is either an interactive html file or a word (docx) single file.
